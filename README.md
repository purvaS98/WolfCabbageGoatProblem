What is WolfCabbageGoat problem ?

It is a classic river crossing puzzle where wolf, cabbage and goat need to cross the river. But there are few conditions that need to be taken in account.
1. Only two objects can cross the river at a time.
2. The wolf cannot be left alone with goat (as it will eat it)
3. The goat cannot be left alone with cabbage (as it will eat it)

The implementation will extend the BFS and DFS implementation from above github repository and output the order in which the items cross the river.
